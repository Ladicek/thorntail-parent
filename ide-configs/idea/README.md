- In IntelliJ on the main menu, choose `File` | `Import Settings...`
- Locate the `wildfly-swarm-intellij-settings.jar` file and click OK.
- In the Select Components to Import dialog ensure `Code style schemes` is checked and click OK.

You should now have a new code style profile named `wildfly-swarm`.
